# Aeolian

A Clojure console application that injests (currently) a limited set of source code metrics and creates a musical representation of these metrics using [ABC Notation][1].

The name, Aeolian, apart from being a Greek musical mode, refers to a leading company in the production of [player pianos][2], which takes punched paper as input and drives a mechanical piano.
